# fabric-hermitcraft-mods
A collection of Mod files for Minecraft 1.20.4.

These have been tested while running a Fabric Minecraft cient connecting to a Vanilla Minecraft Server.

Mod ideas were taken from xisumavoid's YouTube Video

I have only focused on Client Side mods here. No Server mods have been explored yet.


Disclaimer - All of the below is very safe to do, but please be aware that you do this at your own risk.

## Installation of Resource Packs

MINECRAFT CAN REMAIN RUNNING WHEN INSTALLING RESOURCE PACKS.

Resource packs are all taken from https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs/

Download all .ZIP files from:

https://github.com/shoodidagen/fabric-hermitcraft-mods/tree/0d9b064055a997e0c0dc27ba4daf4a0a70faecf9/resourcepacks 

and save to:

'%appdata%\Roaming\\.minecraft\resourcepacks'

To enable these - Select 'Resource Packs' from the main minecraft menu:

Then Enable the Resource Packs.
### NOTE - DO NOT ENABLE THE ONE CALLED VanillaTweaks_LightLevels.zip - This is very useful but only use this when you specifically need to see light levels.

Resource packs can be enabled from the main menu in Minecraft and also 'on the fly' whilst connected to a server/game.

## Installation of Client-Side Mods

MINECRAFT SHOULD BE CLOSED AND NOT RUNNING WHEN INSTALLING THE MODS

Mods are only for version 1.20.4 - URLS will be placed here to provide ability to grab updated mods for later versions.

### Install Fabric

Visit the following link:

https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/

![Fabric Website Screenshot](https://github.com/shoodidagen/fabric-hermitcraft-mods/blob/b4c76342f8bfaeaef58be71c8ab6c48939f3fe75/screenshots/Fabric-Website.png)

Click the large 'DOWNLOAD' button. Then, with Minecraft NOT running, open the installer.

This should locate your default launcher location AUTOMATICALLY which may look something like c:\users\<yourname>\Roaming\\.minecraft

If it automatically populates, you can simply click INSTALL.
However, if not, input the location of your minecraft install. In the screenshot i've used %appdata%.

Next - Open the Minecraft Launcher as you normally would, and make sure 'FABRIC' is selected from the list of availabale launchers. Then run Fabric for the first time by clicking PLAY. Once it has loaded for the first time - CLOSE IT. We only needed to run it once to create the Mod folder.

Next - Download the contents of the MOD folder here:

https://github.com/shoodidagen/fabric-hermitcraft-mods/tree/f69eafeeb3df063df9c9ed61cecb76d55c8f7877/mods

Put all of the .JAR files here:

'%appdata%\Roaming\\.minecraft\mods'

It should look like this, there should be one folder called 'mods' within the main Minecraft folder and within this mod folder are the individual .jar files.

Once completed - Run the Minecraft Launcher once more and launch Fabric again:

Now you have all of the mods available. You should see a 'MOD' option in the minecraft menu like below:

This will allow you to configure mods:

Now - Connect to any vanilla server and have fun!
