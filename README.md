## Installation of Client-Side Mods

Mods are only for version 1.20.4 - URLS will be placed here to provide ability to grab updated mods for later versions.

### Install Fabric

Visit the following link:

https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/

Click the large 'DOWNLOAD' button. Then, with Minecraft NOT running, open the installer.

This should locate your default launcher location which may look something like c:\users\<yourname>\Roaming\\.minecraft

However, if not, input the location of your minecraft install. In the screenshot i've used %appdata%.

Next - Open the Minecraft Launcher as you normally would, and make sure 'FABRIC' is selected from the list of availabale launchers. Then run Fabric for the first time by clicking PLAY. Once it has loaded for the first time - CLOSE IT. We only needed to run it once to create the Mod folder.

Next - Download the contents of the MOD folder here:

https://github.com/shoodidagen/fabric-hermitcraft-mods/tree/f69eafeeb3df063df9c9ed61cecb76d55c8f7877/mods

Put all of the .JAR files here:

'%appdata%\Roaming\\.minecraft\mods'

It should look like this, there should be one folder called 'mods' within the main Minecraft folder and within this mod folder are the individual .jar files.

Once completed - Run the Minecraft Launcher once more and launch Fabric again:

Now you have all of the mods available. You should see a 'MOD' option in the minecraft menu like below:
